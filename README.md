Dumping ground for home automation information.

## Home Assistant

### Ideas
- Figure out media player UI for downstairs (eg. switch between TV and projector)
- Upstairs media player UI should check which input is selected and change what the volume keys affect (eg. which chromecast?)

## General Ideas
- Use EufyCam to figure out who is home and perform specific actions
